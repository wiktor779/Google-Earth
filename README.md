# Google-Earth
The purpose of this project was to create an algorithm which detects houses on satellite images. 
The project is deployed on <a href="https://wiktorbieda.com/house-detector" title="About Me">AWS</a> so you can try how it works by yourself.

## Roadmap
  - [x] scrape satelitare data
  - [x] label data
  - [x] train yolo model
  - [x] create api
  - [x] deploy on AWS
  - [ ] scrape more data
  - [ ] data augumentation
  - [ ] try different detection models


## Built With

* [SUPERVISELY](https://supervise.ly/) - the leading platform for entire computer vision lifecycle
* [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) - real-time object detection system
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively
* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) -AWS has the services to help you build sophisticated applications with creased flexibility, scability and reliability
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Docker makes development efficient and predictable
